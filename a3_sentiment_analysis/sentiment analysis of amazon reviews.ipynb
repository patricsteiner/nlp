      "[\"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!\", \"... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help.  We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.\", \"......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!\", \"... and I'm one of them. It's not water-tight, the plastic thing that helps them sit upright is just in the way when you're trying to put a bigger baby in it- just a total joke. We ended up putting it in a bathtub full of water so our son had someplace to sit but it's a huge waste of money, water and effort! Don't buy a product when over half the people reviewing it hated it!\", \"...So today I bought the ISIS...and brought it home, the assembly kind of confused me at first (Which really it shouldn't but I am worn out from having a 3 year old and a new baby lol) and I thought it might not be put together right but it actually was and I got the hang of the pumping after about the 2nd try to figure it out. The milk started to flow and I was able to empty both breasts in about 10-15 mins. It was absolutely wonderful! They were SO full and so painful and now they are soft and I can actually BREASTFEED my daughter since they aren't so huge and sore. The pump is wonderful though, absolutely NO pain at all unless you push on the pump too hard and it can't get stuck because once you release the handle, it's designed to release the pressure. It is so painless that I actually find it easier to pump than to feed her! It's also great for storing milk to  for late night feedings as opposed to sitting there trying to wake up enough to breastfeed. I love this pump, it was worth EVERY penny!\", \"...of this gate.  We were a little skeptical about it at first, as with anything we buy online, but it has been awesome.  It's a very sturdy gate with easy mechanics.  Very simple.  We bought for the top of our extra-wide stairway 5 minutes after our 7-month-old took his first tumble.  We are so much more relaxed now because we know the gate will keep him safe.  It's more attractive than we had anticipated.  As for the quality...it's very sturdy and easy to install if you have studs in the right places and a power drill.  My guess is that those who rated it poorly either installed it wrong or didn't attach it to studs.  Great product.  Worth every penny.\", \"...I really wanted to get him used to the bottle so that I could leave him with my brother, and nothing else worked so I tried the Avent. Well, it didn't work either. My kid preferred the real thing. I guess the Avent doesn't work for everybody....\", '...but otherwise it\\'s great! My daughter loves the \"big girl freedoms\" it affords her. She can turn in the bathroom light, get on the potty and see in the mirror to brush her teeth!', '...a little difficult to get \"the mold\" to the ideal size to make it look right in the frame.Bottomline - I recommend this.Tips - Make sure you have atleast one other helper while making the actual imprint.  And maybe an additional person for a photo op.', '....and I would never have bought a second electric! All the other moms I know said get a Medela Pump in Style, but I thought if I could just *maybe* get a pump that took up 1/4\" the space and made NO noise for $50, I\\'d try it. I\\'m not at all interested in trying another pump. I love having two, so I can keep one at work and one at home, or on weekends, when traveling, I can use one and then use the other, and both will be clean. I like the Avent bottles and nipples too. It took a series of complicated training sessions to show my husband how to properly assemble and use the Playtex Ventaire bottles, but the Avent bottles require a nipple, that\\'s it! So easy!']\n"

Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!', 'GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.', 'TOTALLY Useless! The 2 pieces will not stay together when you put any kind of pressure on the cord.  Get some retrofits at Window Coverings Safety Council instead!', 'BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS 2 MONTHS OLD. NOW 8 MONTHS STILL USING IT. I LIKED THAT IT FOLDED UP FOR EASY STORAGE.  SOME OF THE OTHER BABY BATH TUBS ARE SO BIG AND BULKY. IT ALSO IS VERY STURDY.', \"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BATH. If you have bought the bath already look in the creases for bacteria that's growning. I didn't realize there was so much dirt and grim in my son's bath tub until I saw it floating one day and looked into all the cracks and was mortified.\", \"THis sheet is okay and gets the job done, but I was disappointed with how it was constructed.  There isn't any elastic on if and it looks as it it could have been sewn by me - kind of fits like a pillow case, but wit hthe opening down the back of it instead of at the head or foot of the mattress.  I feel like I could have bought the material and made it myself.  Maybe I'll do that in the future and use this as a guide for how to put one together.  All in all it works and washes fine, but not what I expected.  I wouldn't pay too much for it.\", \"LOVE this pack n play!! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors.  There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment.  It's very easy to put up and take down.\", \"MY NIPPLES CRACKED SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET MY CHILD TO LATCH ON THE RIGHT WAY. BUT I STIKK WANTED TO BERASRTFEED AS LONG AS I COULD. SO I WENT TO THE STORE AND PURCHASED THIS PUMP. IT WAS THE CHEAPEST AND IT WORKED GREAT. ON THE FIRST TRY, I WAS ABLE TO COLLECT 10 OUNCES IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.I ALSO LOVE THE CARRYING CASE THAT IT COMES WITH, VERY DESCREET.\", \"MY SON IS NOW 9 WEEKS OLD, AND WE HAVE TRIED ALMOST ALL THE BOTTLES ON THE MARKET.  THE PLAYTEX BOTTLES ARE THE BEST.  THEY ARE SO EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.  MY HUSBAND EVEN AGREES!  BEFORE USING THE PLAYTEX, WE HAD THE DR BROWNS BOTTLES.  THESE WORKED ALSO VERY WELL,BUT THE ONLY COMPLAINT WE HAD WAS THE EXTRA TIME NEEDED TO CLEAN EVEY LITTLE PART OF THE VENTING SYSTEM.  MY HUSBAND AND I COULD NOT DEAL WITH THEM ANY MORE, AND TOOK THE ADVICE FROM MY MOTHER WHO SUGESTED THE PLAYTEX FROM THE START.  I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ORIGINAL NURSER BECAUSE OF THE PLASTIC IT'S MADE WITH.  THE NEW PREMIUM BOTTLE  SEEMS TO HAVE SHARP EDGES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE.

      "[\"Although I haven't seen it, my 2 year old niece loves it and that's what matters, so all is well :)\", 'Not that==> I &lt==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:\"WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!\"I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of\"somebody\\'s\" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!', \"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)\", \"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.\", \"I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it's because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)\", 'I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :)', 'The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\\'s extra large containment area you don\\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to \"try harder\", then call again if I couldn\\'t get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it\\'s your gamble.  I didn\\'t take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.  On the bright side, I really haven\\'t felt that it\\'s gotten dirtier than a lysol wipe could handle- so despite that lack of helpfulness that the customer service folks could offer me, I would still recommend the product itself to a friend.', \"My friends think I am strange, but I have to show my Diaper Champ off to anyone that comes in my house:) I recieved a diaper genie as a gift when I had my daughter three years ago and hated it. When I got pregnant this time, I decided to try something different. The Diaper Champ works great and I am saving tons of money not having to buy special bags. My 3 year old loves to turn the handle for me after I change the infant - some of my adult friends can't even figure out how to turn the Diaper Genie!!!\", \"The diaper wipes get stuck in the mechanism, making it unable to properly flip over. (edited, one year later to report:)I recently stopped using this item because the baby's room started to smell like urine, etc, after a few days. It didnt block the smell of the diapers. I am not sure diaper pails can really DO such a thing, but if they can, then this product isnt doing it's job. I started putting each diaper in a ziploc bag before throwing it away in this Diaper Champ, hoping that it would take away the stench of old diapers...no such luck. Now I just take the diaper with me and throw it away outside or in the main kitchen trash that gets taken out each night. I would take away my three stars and give two or onw, but I can't change what I put originally.\", \"Buy 2 of these, so you can have a clean one ready while you do laundry.Usually, I write Good Things and Bad Things, but I have no complaints - so this time, only Good Things!Good Things:1) Easy to get on and off.2) Soft cotton top over waterproof bottom.3) You can put your 'cute' sheets underneath, and really never have to change them, because they never get dirty. So you only need 1 set of pricey sheets if looks are your concern.4) What else do you need out of a crib sheet? :)\"]\n"

I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.', \"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!\", \"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.\", \"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!\", \"Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!\", \"I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.\", \"This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.\", \"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.\", \"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!\"]\n"

       "[('So I read through the other reviews and I think that a handful of people must have gotten a defective product or something. My baby is a bit over 2 months now, and we use the car seat almost daily, and use the stroller almost constantly. It\\'s not perfect, but I still gave it a 5 star because the very few things that bother me are really not a big deal (in my opinion), and the good vastly outweighs the bad.The not-so-perfect:*The car seat canopy doesn\\'t attach to the seat. It\\'s seriously not even a big deal, and if THAT\\'S the major design flaw in the car seat, then I\\'m fine with that!*The basket for the stroller is a bit small. Again, not really caring about that, as there could be much worse things wrong!I would add that it doesn\\'t fit in most shopping carts up in the child area, so you have to put it in the basket.... BUT you are supposed to because it is unsafe the other way. We use the stroller whenever we are shopping, it\\'s so easy!I have heard people on here complaining about \"major problems\", and I just am not seeing them. Examples:*Canopy material being \"flimsy\": Did they receive the same system?! This stuff is super durable and very thick! I would have to break something to make it flop down at all. I even have hung a blanket over when we were walking towards the sun and it was in my son\\'s face, and absolutely NO sagging. And it was a thicker, heavier blanket. So ignore THAT person.*Hard to fold up (stroller): Again... are they serious? I have had NO problem getting the thing folded or unfolded while dealing with the baby in his car seat plus my 5 and 6 year old daughters PLUS groceries. One-handed, not a problem at all. And I have folded it up with the seat fully reclined and fully up... no problems. I don\\'t know if these people got the same travel system!*The stroller is bulky: At this point I decided all these people were rich and had only ever seen expensive strollers. I\\'m poor. My last travel system was the cheapest one at Walmart. The stroller didn\\'t fit in my TRUNK for crying out loud! This stroller folds up to a VERY compact size, it is NOT super wide... it is an umbrella stroller compared to what I\\'m used to!*The car seat is too heavy/big: Yes, it is big. It\\'s the exact reason I got it. My husband is 6\\'4\", my dad is 6\\'8\". My baby grew 4 inches his first month of life. He\\'s PROBABLY going to be tall! So I picked a seat that had a higher weight and height limit so I wasn\\'t buying a new seat in 3 months! Again, we\\'re poor, we can\\'t buy a new car seat every few months.*My baby is \"squished\": You don\\'t want your kid to have a whole lot of room to go side to side in their car seat. Whiplash and all that.*The straps get twisted: I don\\'t even know exactly what people are talking about here. I have yet to have twisted straps. What are they DOING with it that they get twisted?*The stroller straps are \"flimsy\": How fast do you plan on going with this stroller? Are you going to be taking it off jumps!? This stroller is NOT a jogging stroller. It is meant to be used while walking. If you are worried about \"accidents\" then you should rethink what kind of walks you\\'ll be taking your baby on.Things I LOVE about the system:*The height and weight limits. Again, he has some tall family. There isn\\'t a man in his lineage that is under 6 foot. His dad was a huge baby, weighing 40 lbs at the age of 3. I wanted to make sure we were not buying a new car seat right away, as most only go up to 20 or 22 pounds. He\\'s 13 lb 4 oz, 23\" at 2 months... and he was 4 weeks early.*It\\'s longer than most. People view this as a problem, and it IS difficult to fit in our vehicle. Luckily, I am shorter and so I just make sure he\\'s behind me, or my husband with the 38\" inseam gets too squished. This IS a reason we got this exact seat. I want to make sure he\\'s rear-facing as long as possible after 1 year, and this helps that, as he will be more comfortable.*The stroller is AWESOME! The car seat snaps on and off super easily and securely, and I love that the canopies work together to COMPLETELY cover my baby from the sun :) It\\'s a smooth ride, my baby sleeps right away while riding (even on bumpier sidewalks). It folds up one-handed like a breeze, and it super compact and light. I can lift it one-handed into the back of my van. And I am NOT a strong woman! I love that the child\\'s tray goes down and actually provides added slip-out protection, and it is super easy to move. The handle is not too low or high, I\\'m 5\\'5\" and my husband is 6\\'4\" and we are both able to push him comfortably.*The colors are GREAT! He is one stylin\\' baby!*Super comfy car seat. As mentioned, I was only able to get the cheapest of the cheap for my daughter. This car seat has super nice padding, and the material is really nice! I have not had any pilling on his seat, as some have mentioned, either.All in all, this is the best purchase we made, and I love it! I will be sad when we are unable to use it anymore, but I have a feeling that won\\'t be for a very long time!',\n",
       "  5),\n",
       " ('Love love LOVE this bag and the Licorice Twirl pattern!!!!  I use it as a purse (haven\\'t loaded anything for my 4 year old daughter in it yet!). Excuse my LONG review, but I like to know EVERYTHING before I spend $100 on something, so here you go.First, I love Ju-Ju-Be products.  They are well thought out, well made, and super cute! I have been thinking of parting with my Shadow Waltz BFF now that my daughter is 4 and I find myself not using it for her \"stuff\" anymore, or even as a backpack like I had planned (one of the great features of the BFF is that it converts to a backpack). But I still wanted something that could function as a toddler (not diaper :-) bag.  This totally fit the bill, and I have NO REGRETS!Here\\'s why:SIZE:I am 5\\' 0\" tall.  I do not have a problem with it being too short, too long, or too big.  It looks like a normal purse, NOT a diaper bag (I love that).  The comfortable padded strap has not slipped (length) at all as someone else suggested, nor has it slipped off my shoulder. I can shorten it enough that it hangs like a normal handbag.  I can lengthen it enough that I can wear it cross body when I\\'m shopping or pushing the stroller.  (Cross-body might be a problem for those of average to taller height, but I can\\'t speak to that....) Although I have not tried it yet (because I\\'m always wearing the bag), I think it would clip to a small stroller, such as an umbrella stroller, easily (small because the width from each ring on the bag is probably only about 15-16\" at full stretch). Whether or not your stroller tips over with it is dependent on your stroller, really, not the bag.  A well-balanced stroller will not tip over with a small load on the handles. Where the strap loops through the rings is where you\\'d use your stroller clips. (I have the JJB clips, which work great.) It would probably also fit nicely under the stroller in the basket because of it\\'s narrowness and width and height.FEATURES:On the back there is a pocket the full length of the bag, which is where the included matching changing pad is stored (but I don\\'t use it).  An iPad will fit perfectly, but you won\\'t be able to snap it closed (iPad too tall).  Or a coloring book, or a couple thin books (like easy readers). There are the standard JJB crumb drains there, so I try to remember not to drop change or a pen in there, as it might slide out.In the front there is a big zippered pocket which contains two smaller mesh pockets (mine hold a coin purse in one, and lip balm, a tiny hand sanitizer, lipstick--things I want to grab easily without undoing my whole purse) a big zippered pocket (I keep receipts and coupons in there), a stretchy key fob and more room still--I had my thin 6x4\" wallet in there, as well as a few pens and pencils.BEHIND that pocket, but still on the outside front of the purse, is a zippered soft-lined pocket (like in other JJB bags) for a cell phone or camera (or whatever).  I don\\'t know why, but I love this pocket.  I never used it on my BFF because I kept my phone in my purse.  But since this IS my purse now, I keep my iPhone in there.  It fits without a phone-case, and with an Otterbox case (although it is harder to get in and out because the Otterbox is grippy, so there is friction--but it still is a great place to keep the phone). Because it is such a secure pocket, I just took the Otterbox off and put on a thin hard decorative case and not it slips in nice and easy. It is so convenient to grab my phone from that pocket--easy, quick access when the phone rings (you can actually hear it from here, rather than buried inside your bag) or if I need the calculator while shopping.  Like I said, I really like this feature!The MAIN compartment, which has a nice zipper closure with a grab-tab on one side (and zips closed so that if the purse is on your left shoulder you are pulling the zipper toward the front, instead of backwards --well, it would be backwards if it were on your right shoulder), has three mesh pockets and a small deep zippered pocket, and a full-length zippered pocket.  I can\\'t even fill up this bag. The large zippered pocket and two mesh pockets are on the \"back\" inside, while the small zippered pocket and remaining mesh pocket are on the \"front\" inside. The small zippered pocket is narrow and deep.  I can\\'t figure out what to put in there because I can\\'t fit my hand in there easily (it\\'s that narrow) I tried change, but it was too deep to access easily.  I would probably put some things in there that I already have in a pouch to keep it organized.  Anyway, the mesh pouch next to it is deep and wide enough to keep my wallet in now.  But it would not fit a standard long wallet (too tall). However, there is PLENTY of room within the bag to hold your wallet.  I did have my Bose earbud zippered holder in there and it fit great. The other two mesh pockets are holding 1) a hankie, pack of Kleenex and little re-usable shopping bag pouch, and 2) a small calendar planner, checkbook, pen, a Kindle Paperwhite, and room for more. The large zippered pouch is basically empty--haven\\'t needed it yet.  Whatever you put in there will be up against your body, so it is not good for anything bulky, since you will feel the bumps.  So papers (receipts, etc) would be a good option.[I am only telling you what is in MY bag so you can get a better idea of what will fit in YOUR bag]Inside the main compartment I have only a few things (since everything else fit in pockets!)--a small brush, a pouch with all my misc. items (like pocket knife, a few hairbands and clips for myself and my daughter, nail file, and all that garbage I could probably be keeping in that odd-shaped zipper pouch...), a travel packet of Wet Ones wipes (they fit in one of the mesh pockets but I didn\\'t like how tall they stuck out--although still below the bag\\'s zipper) the earbuds holder. There is SO Much more room in there.  If you use separate zippered pouches in your bag, you can keep things organized in there. It\\'s big. I think I could fit a change of toddler clothes or some diapers and wipes in there too--but--YEY--I don\\'t have to carry that stuff anymore.  [keep in mind that the more you have in the inside pockets, the more they stick out into the main compartment area--you can still fit lots in there, but you\\'ll have to dig around more]On the outside are two thin insulated bottle pockets (one on each end) that are flush against the bag (not \"open\" and sticking out like on a normal diaper bag).  I have (at separate times) fit a regular sized bottle of water, a thin tall flip top snack cup, a regular sized (not short and stubby) sippy cup in there and they are secure.  I can not fit my travel coffee cup though (like I could in the BFF). Right now I keep my Rx sunglass case in one so it is super-handy. I often drop change or other small items in these pockets, or even my keys if I don\\'t want to unzip the front pocket and clip them.CHANGING PAD:This pad is not the regular JJB memory foam pad.  It is super thin, so it fits in that back pocket without ANY bulk, or you could probably fold it up even smaller and maybe put it inside the bag (but I never wanted something that had been on public bathroom counters/changing tables with a dirty kid tushie on it to be in my main diaper bag compartment!). I\\'m trying to figure out how I can use it (maybe as a placemat when eating out??) since I\\'ll never use it for its intended purpose.  It might make a nice clean place to set the coloring book or something when out and about, such as waiting at the doctor\\'s office.  Hmmm....You can seriously load this bag down. Because the front large pocket fits so much, you can end up quite bulky there. I\\'ve seen some good YouTube videos on how people have packed their Hobo Be bags--check them out if you are still not sure about this product.  But I\\'m telling you, if you want a \"diaper bag\" that does NOT look like a diaper bag (other than the strap is pretty wide and has that pad on the shoulder), or you are looking for a \"next stage\" toddler/Preschooler bag, this is it, in my opinion.  I\\'ve seen other fancier \"purse\" diaper bags, but a) $$$, and b) they were too fancy for my style. This is cute and casual.Since there is so much extra room in this bag, I\\'ll probably pack my matching Be Quick with stuff for my girl--extra undies (just in case :-), crayons, a pad of paper, some disposable placemats, a snack pouch, hair stuff, maybe a juicebox, a few bandaids...all that good stuff.OH! I should mention, if you are really using this as a full-on diaper bag, you can pretty much fit all your mommy-stuff in the front pocket exclusively (wallet, keys, chapstick, pen, etc), and use the entire rest of the bag for kid stuff.  Had I had this bag from the beginning, that\\'s what I would have done.DISLIKES:The bottle pockets are a little hard to use one-handed.  In other words, you need one hand to stretch open the pocket, and the other to place the bottle in. You can\\'t just slide something fat in.  The pockets are BIG enough, but the elastic is tight (i.e. secure!), so you have to stretch it out to fit something in (even my sunglass case).I really can\\'t say enough good things about the Hobo Be.  All the normal JJB stuff applies--teflon treated fabric, satin light colored lining so you can see things you put inside!, metal hardware.  Love it. A bit pricy, but worth it. And if you like a Ju-Ju-Be pattern or product, snatch it up, because they don\\'t stick around forever.UPDATE 11/20/13:The bag hooks to the umbrella stroller with the Ju-Ju-Be clips really well.  It is the perfect width.',\n",

       " ('As the mother of 3 boys I am always on the look out for the safest and most affordable items I can find. We purchased our very first Recaro seat in 2008.Recaro Como G2 Child Safety Convertible Car Seat, Skywas our introduction into the world of Recaro products and let\\'s just say while the price tag may seem a little intimidating, I would NOW pay 5x\\'s that for one of these seats!Recaro Como G2 Child Safety Convertible Car Seat, Skywas purchased for our then 8 month old son. He weighed 24lbs and was WELL over the limit for his carrier style seat. Our initial convertible purchase wasEddie Bauer Deluxe Convertible Car Seat, Granite. We intended to extended rear face our child and thought this one would suffice. I will not go into great detail about this seat but suffice it to say it was NOT what we expected and never felt safe - not to mention the RF safety rating only went to 30lbs! We decided to make an investment in the Como, it was the best purchase we EVER made. It allowed us to ERF our son to 40lbs and FF to 65. After discovering we were expecting again in 2009 we began a hunt for an additional Recaro for the time our newest would leave his bucket style seat. This time we opted forChicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat And Base In Midorito get our newborn to the proper size and weight to move to his Recaro convertible car seat. We decided to purchase aRECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opalfor our 3 yr old since this seat would take him all the way to 80 lbs in one of its 3 positions and pass along theRecaro Como G2 Child Safety Convertible Car Seat, Midnight Desertto the baby.As was the case when our 1st Recaro arrived we were BEYOND impressed. The weight of the seat tells you it is NOT the flimsy little piece of plastic  like many other seats currently on the market. It has steel reinforcement on the frame, the LATCH and tether are SO SIMPLE to install, the headrest has impact absorbing foam on either side, the 5 point safety harness is a simple harness to use and adjust but is VERY high quality. I have NEVER operated a seat that was easier to adjust for height than a Recaro. There is NO threading of the straps into different positions or taking the seat apart, it is as simple as turning a knob!! On a less practical note, it is also a really PRETTY seat! The color contrasts are unusual for a seat in today\\'s market.As I stated in my opening thought, safety is the TOP priority followed by cost benefit. After weighing all of our options we came to the conclusion that while the Recaro seats are a bit pricey on the front end, if you do the math and spread the cost over the number of years you will be able to actually USE the seats it is a nominal cost. For us it is even less because we will have had 2 children get 2 years of use out of our 1st Recaro and will be purchasing anotherRECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opalwhen it is time for our youngest to switch to a \"booster\" style.Recaro seats are also HIGHLY rated by Consumer Reports and the NHTS test done on the seats out perform other manufacturers. These seats are the ONLY seat I will consider purchasing for my children.On a related note, our 3 year old LOVES his Recaro seat. His grandparents purchased a less expensive seat for use in their vehicles and he refuses to ride in it. We have to take the seat out of our minivan and install it in their SUV each and every-time...I told them to buy a Recaro but they thought they \"cost too much\"...thankfully this is not a huge issue since the Recaro seats are literally \"click and go\", no fighting with the seat to get a proper install. They\\'re just as easy to remove, this is a GREAT feature.Really what is your child\\'s safety worth? It is invaluable to us so we will pay a few extra dollars up front. As is previously noted though, in the long run, it is NOT more expensive than the \"affordable\" models since those have to be replaced frequently as you must purchase a new seat to meet weight requirements every 10-16 months! We paid $269 for ourRecaro Como G2 Child Safety Convertible Car Seat, Midnight Desertin 2008. Our 3 year old got 2 full years of use, this works out to  be a mere $11.20 PER MONTH. This number is only valid if you ONLY use it for 24 months. With the weight limits being as high as they are on this seat it IS entirely possible you could get 36 months of use out of the seat. When all is said and done we will have used the seat for a total of 48 months between 2 children. For us the cost of theRecaro Como G2 Child Safety Convertible Car Seat, Midnight Desertper month is only $5.60 per month!!! LESS than the cost of a \"value meal\" at McDonald\\'s once a month! We will get an additional 3-5 years of use out of theRECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opalmaking the initial investment of $269 (*SHIPPED FREE 2 DAY WITH AMAZON MOM!) a mere $3.73 per month per child. I would venture to say that amount seems laughable to KNOW your child is as safe as they can be on the road. Let\\'s face it, as a parent one of the scariest things we have to do is admit we have NO control over things like a rouge vehicle coming out of nowhere and slamming into our car with out children buckled inside.  This was an easy decision my my husband and I after we realized the ONLY thing we DO control and we DO have power over is making sure our children are strapped properly in a  car seat that will DO ITS JOB. Our child\\'s car seats are NOT the place to cut corners. We\\'ve opted to buy our children the BEST, most safe seats. We\\'re exercising the ONLY control we have in an otherwise uncontrollable situation. As I have demonstrated though, the cost  REALLY is nominal. I would still pay 5, 10 or even 20x\\'s the amount we spent on the boys seats - they are the closest thing to \"piece of mind\" I am able to find for sale anywhere!GREAT VALUE - PRICELESS!',\n",

       " (\"This review is going to compare 3 Ju-Ju-Be bags.  I'm writing a lot because I wish I had this info before I started shopping for a diaper bag.  I am a first time mom so I am probably packing different than a mom that's been around the block.  Also, we are cloth diapering, but not 100% of the time.  We use the disposable, biodegradable inserts for the cloth covers when we want to pack light - and those things take up less room than traditional disposables.  But I wanted a bag that gave me options for either type of diaper.  Here is what I found.  I hope reading this long post will help you save some time and return shipping fees while shopping!!!I already had the Ju-Ju-Be BFF and Be Prepared before I bought the Be Right Back backpack.  I bought them at a different store (one with an amazing return policy) so I left the tags on and debated the bags for a long time.  I packed them and repacked them so many times and this is what I came up with.  The BFF is too small and the Be Prepared is too big.  Both are GREAT bags.  This company really makes quality products with excellent organization!  Let me tell you, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to quality - I will not deal with poorly made stuff breaking down on me.  Straight to the donation station or trash if something sucks.  This company does not suck...they manufacture very well made products with very good material, zippers, snaps, magnets, etc.  Go to their website to learn about the fabric treatment process and ease of care.  (My friends that bought the cheapo bags are now drooling over the Ju-Ju-Be quality.)  So I loved both bags and I really wanted to keep them.  But I couldn't get past the BFF just being a little too small (and I'd have to have a second bag with me)...and the Be Prepared is super huge and I felt like I was carrying a suitcase.BFF:  This bag is really awesome.  The organization is surprisingly smart.  The inside pockets look small but they hold tons.  You can fit a full size wipes pack in any of the four large interior pockets (but you can't fill all pockets that much at the same time).  The smaller back interior pockets with the zippers are smaller than the open pockets but still hold quite a lot of little stuff like bibs, socks, Boogie Wipes or whatever kind of little stuff you carry around.  The front interior zipper pocket is long and shallow.  I kept putting my nursing cover in that pocket...anything bigger would bulge into the front &#34mommy pocket&#34 and make that space smaller.  The outside pockets are insulated and hold a baby bottle or water bottle...I have a Kleen Kanteen 27 or 28 oz bottle and it did fit in that pocket but it stuck out a lot because its really tall...I didn't like that (if I was keeping the BFF bag I'd have to get smaller water bottle, and I didn't like that because I drink tons of water).  If you load up all the inside pockets you don't have a whole lot of room left for the diapers and blankets etc.  The main compartment leaves much to be desired as far as space...if you're running to the coffee shop with your girlfriends and going home you'll be fine...but you cannot pack for a whole day in here.  The &#34mommy pocket&#34 on this bag is well organized but I found it a little too small.  I needed to fit all of my personal items in there because there was no room in the main part of the bag.  I don't carry that many things for myself: a wallet, coin purse, pen, chap stick, tiny hand lotion, cell phone, eye drops and extra pair of contact lenses.  I could not fit all that in the mommy pocket even when I put my cell phone in the separate little cell phone pocket.  My take on this bag: Its wonderful if you pack really light.  I was not even trying to get cloth diapers in there and it was still tight.  If you don't need burp clothes and a blanket and an extra outfits you'd be fine...maybe a mom with one toddler that is past the bottle stage.  I'm bummed that it didn't work because I really wanted to keep it.  It really is a cute bag.BE PREPARED: This bag is the mother ship!  Its very much like the BFF but way bigger.  I was thinking of using it for our overnight or weekend bag...if i were to pack this one like the baby's suitcase, and use the Be Right Back backpack like normal when were out of town I'd have everything I needed in those two bags for a weekend.  However, for normal daily use, the Be Prepare is a mammoth and I don't want to lug it around with me while I'm trying to hold my baby...it would fit all my cloth diapers and the kitchen sink...but its over kill for me with one infant.  I might keep this wonderful big bag anyway for weekend trips because we do a lot of those and I think its cool that they match...baby luggage :)BE RIGHT BACK:  This backpack is super cool.  It is very different from the other two bags.  It's almost perfectly in the middle of the 2 other sized bags.  It has way less of the small inside pockets.  Really only 2 big pockets on inside and 2 on outside (plus mommy pocket and 2 outside bottle pockets).  I do not mind at all that it has less pockets because I keep most of my really tiny stuff in the Ju-Ju-Be accessory bags.  If you have a small bag/pouch and don't know where to put it...stick it in the mesh zipper pouch.  This bag is comfortable to wear - definitely more comfortable than the BBF backpack straps even though I loaded it with more items (I think that is because the bag is longer so it sits on your back differently).  I have a bad back from a car accident so comfort is something I really pay attention to.  This bag is easy to get in and out of.  It opens flat, like a suitcase, so no digging for stuff.  Its shaped like a traditional backpack but I don't feel like I'm back in college when wearing it because the prints get big style points.To give you an idea of the space, here is how I pack it up:  I have my breast feeding cover and 6 disposable breast pads in the front pocket with room to spare.  Mommy pocket fits all my personal items that I listed above with room to spare.  Side bottle pockets are deeper, and my tall water bottle that was too big for BFF fits great in this bag.  I have easy access burp clothes in the other bottle pocket because I am still breast feeding (large baby bottle or sippy cup would fit easily).  The pocket on the top, by the grab handle, is super useful.  Right now I am using it for all my different kinds of small wipes packs: face wipes, paci wipes, anti bac wipes, hand sanitizer gel, etc. they all fit.  You could use that spot for so many different things that you want easy access to.  The side zipper compartment for the changing pad is very smart.  Its so out of the way.  I have the pad that came with it in there now and a pack of sanitizing wipes for public bathroom changing table.  I'll need a bigger pad when baby grows but you could fit a massive pad in there...or magazines, or change of clothes, or blanket, or iPad, or anything flat and you really can't even tell that you filled it up...its very comfortable against your back while you wear the bag.  Inside the bag in the zipper mesh pocket I have a large receiving blanket, two changes of 0-3 month clothes, 2 socks and 2 bibs.  In the back mesh pocket I have a Be Mine (packed as a first aid kit) and a similar sized bag with a little mom-fresh-up kit I put together for when I have baby puke in my hair and I look like a mess...kinda a get it together and look normal kit.  (I never could have fit that kit in the BFF and now that I have it I think its important to have somethings for yourself so you don't feel yucky).  Those items never leave the bag without getting restocked.Aside from what I just listed, in the main inside compartment I can fit 2 large burp cloths, and 2 Be Quick bags (one filled with baby items, the other filled with my disposable diaper inserts for when I don't want to bring cloth diapers), a full Fuel Cell cooler, and baby's favorite lovey.  When I do want to carry my cloth diapers I ditch the fuel cell and the Be Quick with the disposables in it.  I can then fit my cloth diaper pouch (the pouch I use is big and could fit 4 full size AIO diapers, 8 cloth wipes, wipe spray, a thin changing pad, and wet bag - so it takes up a lot of space)...then I can still fit the Be Quick with the baby items, the burp cloths, the lovey, a little bag with teethers, and my Rock'n Baby sling.So, the Be Right Back fits tons!  And it works wonderfully if you just put a few things in there.  I'm sure I'll be packing differently as my baby's needs change.  But for now, with an infant, this bag has got me covered for all day in cloth diapers or all day in disposables with a big packed lunch for mom and dad.  It also still works great to pack it light for a shorter trip...I just haven't gotten to where I can pack light all the time personally.  The bag is very versatile as far as what you can take with you.  Where it is not versatile is carry style.  Its a backpack...if you don't like backpacks keep shopping.All the Ju-Ju-Be accessories are made to fit into the main bags.  I highly recommend getting the accessory bags so you can organize yourself and know that your stuff will always fit in your main bag.  Using the smaller bags to organize makes it SO very easy to switch from bag to bag without leaving anything behind on accident.  I love the organization!  There are a few things that are kinda vanishing from the companies website...I think they are revamping a few designs because they are running out of some of their most popular accessories...I expect to see them come back with a newly added pocket or zipper or something.Ju-Ju-Be is good about having lots of print selections to choose from.  I do find a lot of the prints too feminine for my taste, which is why I love the Royal Envy print...honestly, if that Be Prepared bag I have was a different print I'd just return it and buy that bag again later when I really need it...but Royal Envy is discontinued and I really don't want to part with it knowing it won't be available later.  If you are new to this company know this...once you pick out your main bag, if you want to load up on accessories that match you better not wait too long.  I can't believe how fast they sell out - then the print is discontinued and you are left to sadly troll Ebay looking for the pieces you want.  Just buy them when you get the main bag.  They are worth it, and everything from this company has great resale...there are FB groups devoted to buy, sell, trade Ju-Ju-Be stuff.(Side note: This bag is has a very sporty look.  Great for normal days running around.  I also bought a Nest, Dexter diaper bag for dressy occasions.  That bag is very different from this one and it's awesome too but I haven't reviewed it.  And that bag fits all the Ju-Ju-Be accessory bags that I love.  I mentioned my husband as a men's diaper backpack.  It's the Quicksilver Daddy Day Bag.  Great man bag!)I was going to proof read and spell check but after writing all this I'm over it!  Sorry for any typos.  Really hope this helps you.\",\n",

       " ('I am a \"research-aholic\" in general and have researched many different baby products over the past 5 years due to being a mother of 3 and wanting to get the best for the price and not wanting to settle for less...  I live in the Northeast US, so it gets really cold and the weather changes frequently and in extremes on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Anyway, here are the brands I\\'ve used/owed and/or researched extensively and the comparisons:Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJA)Jolly Jumper Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJ)Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP)Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC)Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (yes the CC and the BC are different)JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)JJ Cole toddler bundle me  (JJT)OK...Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) is awesome, I would rate it the best one out of all.  It is a \"shower cap\" cover for the infant car seat, it has a blanket inside that you can velcro closed to keep the baby\\'s face covered and warm and you can velcro it \"up\" to stay open when the baby when you put the baby in the car out of weather\\'s elements...  It has two zippers which allow you to open the carrier and easily access the baby, keep the baby from over heating and you can also \"flap the middle piece down to keep it completely off the baby.  The blanket is a nice feature of this cover.  You can use it alone with the flap open on a warmer day and you can also \"flap\" it down away from the baby as well when not in use.  Another nice thing about the blanket is you can wrap it around baby to keep them warm, there is enough material on both sides to do this..  Some reviewers of this and other carriers stated that there were gaps around the handle, this is true of mostly all the shower cap covers except you can adjust it to cover these gaps.  Also you can take the wrap around blanket and cover the baby as well as feed it through the gaps on the sides to close them if the cover cannot be adjusted to fit around the bottom to close that area.  The outer portion is nylon, like a jacket and it is waterproof, the fleece is substantial and it keeps the infant very, warm. This is an expensive carrier but well worth the money!  This is top notch!Jolly Jumper is just like the carrier described above but without the attached blanket.  Again, overall an excellent carrier.  It is not that much less than the JJA and no matter what climate I would pay the extra money for the JJA just because you can use the blanket alone with the flap of the outer portion of the JJ out and it is a very nice feature to have in the cover.Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP) is another \"shower cap\" cover for the infant carseat but it has an opening in the top with no flap to velcro over baby\\'s face.  I owned this before the JJA and here are some differences.  It is a much thinner material, the fleece isn\\'t as substantial and the outer portion is not waterproof or nylon but a fleece polyester material.  The opening is rather large and I felt as though breezes/wind would go right through the hole and it is definitely not as effective in making the baby too warm, esp. in colder conditions.  To remedy this problem I put a blanket on under the cover and the baby seemed better on 30 degree days from the house to the car but not to take a walk.  I also had to put a hat and make sure the blanket was high on baby to cover the baby\\'s neck or use something to make sure baby\\'s neck was covered due to the hole being so big.  It also gaps more on the side then the JJA and the JJ.  The SP only has one zipper to unzip the baby when inside.  And when you want to keep the baby inside the carrier, you really have to take the whole thing off to leave the baby in to not be covered.  And it is hard to get the baby out without pushing it aside.AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ******* PLEASE SEE*****  it was very scary when I discovered that when you place it on correctly and put it over the infant carseat, I would put my infant carseat into the holster and it WOULD NOT, I repeat WOULD NOT lATCH INTO THE BASE!!!!  There was no way of knowing this unless you checked, (I check my baby each time to make sure the carseat is latched in just by habit), but it would not even be partially latched just completely unlatched....  I felt this was unacceptable....  Even when I tried to adjust it by pulling the bottom portion where the baby\\'s feet would be up, the cover b/c of the elastic would just come up, bunch and be partially off with a gap under the baby\\'s feet so I feel this carrier is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  I paid 2/3 the cost of the JJA.Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC) A lot of people think this is the BC and it is the same price but it is not.  It is a cheap spin off of the BC even though it is the same price.  The fabric is less substantial, it is honestly more like the SP.  Not worth the money and don\\'t make the mistake of getting it.Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) Is BABY\\'S COZY WORLD uses a type of microfiber called microsuede, which is a soft fabric made from synthetic fibers that are an imitation to suede.  It seems like it is a good bang for your buck coming in around twenty dollars which is half of the JJA.  The only thing is if you live in a really rainy climate I don\\'t think it would be as waterproof being microsuede as the JJ or the JJA material.  Another reviewer stated that the BABY\\'S COZY WORLD is reversible (which I am not sure how it can be reversible deeming that it does have a flap that goes over the infants face like the CC, JJA and JJ)?The reviewer also stated that the BC has pacifier clips, which would be a nice feature for toys as well and that is is very thick for all weather and it is the same price as the CC.  ONE THING that many reviews said about the CC and the BC is that the zippers can be dangerous b/c they line up in the same place as a newborns eyes and have the potential for scratching the cornea.  With the JJ and the JJA the zippers do not seem as though they would reach this far.  Maybe the CC and the BC have larger zippers that might spin around in opposite directions esp if it is \"reversible\".  It does have the zippers on both sides to unzip and expose the infant nicely when inside and do not want the infant to overheat while in the carrier.  For the price this seems like it would be a good carrier as well and I would rate the the BC a close second and very comparable to the JJ but does not have a blanket feature like the JJA.JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)is what I owned with my first child who was a premature infant and I only got about 7 months of use out of this cover.  That is why I got the toddler JJ cole after.  It is a different type of carrier than all the others that are reviewed above being that it is not a shower cap style it has an underside to the carrier that is placed under the harness straps and then a layer goes over the baby and is zippered down and around the bottom.  FIRST OF ALL THIS IS DANGEROUS, which I never knew as a new mom, and why they even CAN SELL them as carseat covers is beyond me because if you get into an accident it compresses under the infant because of the added bulk between the seat and the child, (it is like the infant is wearing a jacket) so there is more room in between the harness and the infant deeming it unsafe.  Also, JJ cole now has the lite JJ cole and says that it passed crash tests but The Bundle me Lite\\'s openings do not come anywhere near the hip straps of the harness... meaning they would be improperly routed, thus creating slack.  Here is a picture:[...]  No certified carseat technicians recommend this aftermarket product for the carseat.  Any many if not all carseat companies state if an aftermarket product is used \"inside\" the carseat between the harness and baby it will void all guarantees for safety.  NOT GOOD.JJ Cole toddler (JJT)  Had this mostly with my first child and second and would not use now d/t the same reason above with the JJ.  But it could be nice with a stroller.  The only thing is you do need a hat and something to cover the baby\\'s neck as well.In summary:#1The Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) wins the race, I am very very please with this product, esp the blanket aspect that I think is well worth it!The JJ is basically the same product as the JJA but without the blanket....#2The Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (but make sure it is the BC and not the CC when you purchase it) comes in a close second esp for the price!Hope this review is helpful to you and you now won\\'t have to go through the countless hours of research and will be getting a great product while not wasting any of your time or money on another worthless baby item!!!!',\n",

       " ('I am a \"research-aholic\" in general and have researched many different baby products over the past 5 years due to being a mother of 3 and wanting to get the best for the price and not wanting to settle for less...  I live in the Northeast US, so it gets really cold and the weather changes frequently and in extremes on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Anyway, here are the brands I\\'ve used/owed and/or researched extensively and the comparisons:Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJA)Jolly Jumper Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover (JJ)Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP)Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC)Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (yes the CC and the BC are different many people do not know this....)JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)JJ Cole toddler bundle me  (JJT)OK...Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) is awesome, I would rate it the best one out of all.  It is a \"shower cap\" cover for the infant car seat, it has an attached blanket inside and a peek-a-boo flap that you can velcro closed to keep the baby\\'s face covered and warm and you can also velcro it \"up\" to stay open when when you put the baby in the car.  It has two zippers which allow the cover to be fully opened without removal of the cover and easy access to baby.  And lastly, it keeps the baby from over heating.  When opening the two zippers it enable the ability to \"flip\" the middle piece down keeping it completely off the baby.  The blanket is a nice feature of this cover.  You can use it alone with the two zippers open on a warmer day and you can also flip the blanket down away from the baby as well when not in use.  Another nice thing about the blanket is you can wrap it around baby to keep them warm (it does not go behind the baby but can be placed on the sides of the baby), there is enough material on both sides to do this..  Some reviewers of this carrier cover and other \"shower cap\" cover styles stated that there were gaps around the handle, this is true of mostly all the shower cap covers except you can adjust this one on the sides to cover these gaps.  Also you can take the wrap around blanket and cover the baby as well as feed it through the gaps on the sides to close them if the cover cannot be adjusted on your carrier to fit around the bottom to close that area.  The outer portion is nylon, like a jacket material and it is waterproof, the fleece is substantial and it keeps the infant very, warm. This is an expensive carrier but well worth the money!  This is top notch!Jolly Jumper (JJ) is the same carrier cover as above minus the attached blanket.  Again, overall an excellent cover.  It is not much less money than the JJA and no matter what climate I would personally pay the extra money for the JJA just because you can use the blanket when opening the cover by the zippers and then you still have the option of zippering the carrier for more protection if it is raining or it gets colder.  You can also fold down the blanket and not use it as all on the JJA and use it like a JJ.Summer Infant Poshpouch (SP) is another \"shower cap\" cover for the infant carseat but it has an opening in the top with no flap to velcro over baby\\'s face.  I owned this before the JJA and here are some major differences.  It is a much thinner material, the fleece isn\\'t as substantial and the outer portion is not waterproof or nylon but a fleece polyester material.  The opening is rather large and I felt as though breezes/wind would go right through the hole and it is definitely not as effective in making the baby warm, esp. in colder conditions.  To remedy this problem I put a blanket on underside of the cover and the baby warmer, esp on 30 degree days.  I also had to put a hat and make sure the blanket was high on baby to cover the baby\\'s neck or use something to make sure baby\\'s neck was covered due to the hole being so big.  It also gaps much more on the sides then the JJA and the JJ.  The SP only has one zipper to unzip the baby when inside.  And when you want to keep the baby inside the carrier, you really have to take the whole thing off to leave the baby in in order to not be covered.  And it is hard to get the baby out without pushing it aside.AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ******* PLEASE SEE*****  it was very scary when I discovered that when you place it on correctly and put it over the infant carseat, I would put my infant carseat into the holster and it WOULD NOT, I repeat WOULD NOT lATCH INTO THE BASE!!!!  There was no way of knowing this unless you checked, (I check my baby each time to make sure the carseat is latched in, just by habit), but it would not even be partially latched just completely unlatched....  I felt this was unacceptable....  Even when I tried to adjust it by pulling the bottom portion up, where the baby\\'s feet would be, the cover b/c of the elastic would just come up, bunch and be partially off with a gap under the baby\\'s feet so I feel this carrier is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  I paid 2/3 the cost of the JJA and it is more then the CC and BC.Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover (CC) A lot of people think this is the BC and it is the same price but it is not.  It is a cheap spin off of the BC even though it is the same price.  The fabric is less substantial, it is honestly more like the SP.  Not worth the money and don\\'t make the mistake of getting it.Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) uses a type of microfiber called microsuede, which is a soft fabric made from synthetic fibers that are an imitation to suede.  It seems like it is a good bang for your buck coming in around twenty dollars which is half of the JJA.  The only thing is if you live in a really rainy climate I don\\'t think it would be as waterproof being microsuede as the JJ or the JJA material.  Another reviewer stated that the BABY\\'S COZY WORLD is reversible (which I am not sure how it can be reversible deeming that it does have a flap that goes over the infants face like the CC, JJA and JJ but maybe??)The reviewer also stated that the BC has pacifier clips, which would be a nice feature for toys as well and that is is very thick for all weather and it is the same price as the CC.  ONE THING that many reviews said about the CC and the BC is that the zippers can be dangerous b/c they line up in the same place as a newborns eyes and have the potential for scratching the cornea.  With the JJ and the JJA the zippers do not seem as though they would reach this far.  Maybe the CC and the BC have larger zippers that might spin around in opposite directions esp if it is \"reversible\".  It does have the zippers on both sides (like the JJ and JJA) to unzip and expose the infant nicely when inside.  For the price this seems like it would be a good carrier as well and I would rate the the BC a close second and very comparable to the JJ but does not have a blanket feature like the JJA.JJ Cole infant/original bundle me (JJC)is what I owned with my first child who was a premature infant and I only got about 7 months of use out of this cover due to the fact that infants tend to grow out of it very fast, usually before they are out of their infant carseat.  That is why I got the toddler JJ cole toddler size after.  It is a different type of carrier than all the others that are reviewed above being that it is not a shower cap style it has an underside fabric to the carrier that is placed under the harness straps and then a layer goes over the baby and is zippered down and around the bottom.  FIRST OF ALL THIS IS DANGEROUS, which I never knew as a new mom, and why they even CAN SELL them as carseat covers is beyond me because if you get into an accident it compresses under the infant because of the added bulk between the seat and the child, (it is like the infant is wearing a jacket) so there is more room in between the harness and the infant deeming it unsafe.  Also, JJ cole now has the lite JJ cole and says that it passed crash tests but The Bundle me Lite\\'s openings do not come anywhere near the hip straps of the harness... meaning they would be improperly routed, thus creating slack.  Here is a picture: [...]  No certified carseat technicians recommend this aftermarket product for the carseat.  Any many if not all carseat companies state if an aftermarket product is used \"inside\" the carseat between the harness and baby it will void all guarantees for safety.  NOT GOOD.JJ Cole toddler (JJT)  Had this mostly with my first child (after she was 7 months) and second child and would not use now d/t the same reason above with the JJ.  But it could be nice with a stroller.  The only thing is you do need a hat and something to cover the baby\\'s neck as well.In summary:#1The Jolly Jumper Artic (JJA) wins the race, I am very very please with this product, esp the blanket aspect that I think is well worth it!The JJ is basically the same product as the JJA but without the blanket....#2The Baby\\'s Cozy World Microfiber & Fleece Carrier Cover (BC) (but make sure it is the BC and not the CC when you purchase it) comes in a close second esp for the price!Hope this review is helpful to you and you now won\\'t have to go through the countless hours of research and will be getting a great product while not wasting any of your time or money on another worthless baby item, instead ONLY getting the BEST for your baby!!!!',\n",

       " ('Don\\'t buy this product!I have twins and have intimate experience with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.Overview:They don\\'t decrease the need to burp due to less air intake during feeding.10 parts to clean per bottle and you have to hand wash all parts (dishwashing will not get parts clean)!!!!!!!Cloudy bottles with raised not colored markers: meaning you can\\'t read the measuring markers even in good light.Here is the deal... the primary advantage of this brand/bottle are they are supposed to cut down on air intake and thus decrease the need to burp... really? With my experience they have failed.One bottle/feeding, whether it be a feeding when the babies weighed 5 LB\\'s or now that they weigh 20 LB\\'s still requires that we stop and burp them often (three times or more a bottle), which they eagerly and loudly burp (like Barney on the Simpson\\'s \"bbbbbbuuurrrrp!\") or else the gas gets caught and they throw up formula when they do finally expel the gas. Seems the same as any other bottle and those other brands don\\'t have the other draw backs these have...Cleaning is a pain in the butt!!!!!!!!NEVER dish wash these things. DON\\'T buy those stupid little plastic cages that carry all the parts as all these pieces won\\'t get cleaned properly. There is no being lazy with this system, you HAVE TO HAND WASH every piece. Okay, there are 7 pieces to the system (this includes the cap and travel disc), two of the everyday 7 pieces require you clean them with a pipe cleaner (3 parts to clean with a pipe cleaner and a  dish washer is NOT going to get those holes clean). So you add the 7 pieces and the time it takes to clean the 3 holes with a pipe cleaner and I have a count of 10 PIECES TO WASH PER BOTTLE EVERYDAY!!! That is freaking INSANE! So lets do the math... 10 pieces to clean per bottle x\\'s 20 bottles, cleaned once or more a day... you do the math. Yup, you did the math right, that is 200 pieces to clean per bottle per day! Stupid isn\\'t it? All this for a product that is terribly ineffective.Lastly the annoyance factor, and this was HUGE for me!Time for a brief history to validate that I know what I am talking about: I am a  father of twins that were born premature. Which means we had to continually monitor food intake to ensure the twins ate the appropriate amount of calories. So every feeding, which was every three hours, 24 hours a day for the first four months, had to have a specific amount of fluid in each bottle, then we had to record how much they ate so we could track daily calorie intake. Ya, LOL, THAT is a lot of feeding and a LOT of experience with these bottles.Before I get into this next segment a quick note: on this listing, at the top left hand side are the option to view four photos of he product, the only photo that clearly and truly represents the cloudy nature of this product is the fourth image by \"Mike\" of a girl drinking from a bottle. Look at the product that the girl is using and you will note how truly cloudy the bottles are. Okay, onto my last issue with the bottle....As the twins got older and eating more we migrated from the few glass bottles we had to 8 oz BPA free plastic bottles (since we needed 21 of these bottles we went with plastic instead of glass as we figures the technology was the mechanism and not the container). So now we are using the cloudy PBA free plastic, we still need to monitor the twins intake and record the amount of fluid/food they consume to monitor calories but here is the deal... with these cloudy BPA free plastic bottles it is all but impossible to read the measuring markers. Whether I am trying to read the markers in the well lit kitchen or in the twins room via a night light, I\\'ll say it again, it is all but IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE MEASURE MARKERS on these bottles.Imagine, there you are feeding your baby at 3 AM, you are exhausted, your baby has been eating for 15 minutes so you look at the bottle to see if he had eaten the minimum amount as the baby is getting tired but you can\\'t read the markers. So you twist to position yourself near the nightlight so you can view the marker, you still can\\'t make out the marker readings. Now the baby is getting restless and waking up so you settle down, and use your thumb to try and count the raised markers via brail... you are not sure but you think the baby should eat one more once before putting them down again. Okay, repeat this over and over andover  again. if you can envision what I am talking about please trust me and know that you will want to throw these ill conceived pieces of crap in the trash immediately!!  Not just once but and time and time again... but you don\\'t as you have a good investment in these things! So you think twice. Then you think to warn others....I even wrote to the maker/manufacturer and complained about the fact they have a design flaw in that the often-used-and-critical-measuring-markers are near impossible to read in any light (since the level indicators are raised, like brail, I literally have to feel for the level indictors then count by touch to know the level remaining in the bottle). A flaw that is an insult to me, a user AND a customer, and that they need to correct. Their pathetic and insulting reply? They could not make the ink stick to the bottles so they went with the raised no colored solution. This is all because of the fact the bottles are PBA free (before they switched to PBA free the bottles had colored markers and clear bottles which were SUPER easy to read).  I cry BS to their reply!!!!!  Their pretty little logo with all the fine lines and intricate detail sure has not lost a single pixel of paint/color/detail from our daily washing, therefore any color they could have added to the measure markers would have stayed true too. I just hate lazy, lying corporate structures that won\\'t do right by their customer.So in closing:They don\\'t decrease the need to burp due to less air intake during feeding.10 parts to clean per bottle and you have to hand wash all parts (dishwashing will not get parts clean).Can\\'t read the measuring markers even in good light (I have 20-20 vision)Lying lazy corporation.There, I think that covers it. :-)  Look for another solution. Despite what others may say, you have been warned.',\n",

       " (\"My husband and I did COPIOUS research for car seats before finally purchasing this one for my car and the Diono Radian RXT for his car.  We also looked at the Clek Foonf and Recaro ProRide.  We knew we wanted extending rear facing seats so that is how we narrowed our search to just these seats.  We also wanted something that was solidly built, so that eliminated many of the cheaper seats.Here's the run down:(1) Peg Perego Premium Convertible Car SeatWhat we LIKED:- VERY well built, solid seat!- RF to 45lbs, FF to 70lbs or 49&#34 (though your child will likely outgrow this seat in height before weight . . . the average 6 year old is 49&#34)- Easy clean fabric (fresco jersey)- SUPER SAFE shock absorbing foam that crumples upon impact (though I hope we never test this!)- SUPER QUICK AND EASY to install!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't underscore this enough!  For RF, I just stand behind the seat, leaning into it, click the two latch straps into place, then rock side to side while cinching the straps tight.  With this method it DOES NOT WOBBLE AT ALL!  I did have to insert a small towel under the base to get the right recline angle, but the leveling line provided on the side of the seat makes it SUPER EASY!  I have not installed it FF yet, but that should be even easier!- SUPER LIGHT so combined with ease of install, I can move it from one car to another in about 2 minutes!!!- Our kid is high up so he can see out the windows and he likes that.- Seat comes with nice extra padding for smaller babies (under 22lbs) so we felt safe using it with our little guy (we did, however use an infant carrier seat from 7-18lbs, up to 30&#34).- The head rest part is the BEST on any seat we looked at!!!  Our kids head does not drop forward when he falls asleep AND the shoulder straps automatically rise in height as you raise the headrest, so there is NO RE-THREAD!!!  Super easy to make sure everything is at the right height for your kiddo!- IT FITS RF behind the passenger seat in our TINY Saturn Ion sedan (seriously tiny backseat area) with enough room for a person to still sit in the front seat with it slightly reclined.What we DON'T LIKE:- The seat does sit tall, so I have to tilt my son backwards and then into the seat like a torpedo to clear the door frame (this could be specific to our extremely small car . . . ).  I see this being a problem as he gets bigger (he is only 30&#34 right now).  This seat seems like it will not be conducive to him climbing into it himself.-  This seat comes with very LONG shoulder pads that you will not be able to use with a small child (I am thinking under 3?) because they will prevent you from getting the chest strap up to your child's armpit level (design flaw).  We purchased after market smaller pads to correct this problem.- I am concerned that our little guy will outgrow this seat RF in height looooong before he does in weight (you can only use the headrest RF in the first as you can only use the first 7 headrest positions RF).- The PRICE, ouch!!!  But then again, you get what you pay for and in this seat you really are getting a premium product!!!The bottom line: We picked this seat because it fit our car well and was quick and easy to install from one car to another!(2) Diono Radian RXTWhat we LIKED:- This is a well built, SOLID seat!!!- HIGH weight AND height limits for RF (45lbs or 57&#34) and FF (80lbs 5-point harness / 120lbs high back booster).- Seat sits low, so our son can climb in/out of it himself.- Seat also has a narrow footprint so you can fit three across or fit an infant seat right next to it . . . important because although we have this seat in the center now, we plan to put our next child in the center and move this one over to the window at that point.- Comes with SUPER great shoulder pads that encase the chest clip SO THAT IT CAN'T SLIDE DOWN!!!  I can't underscore how great of a feature this is!!!- The rest of the seat has great padding too.  Comes with infant insert (though we used an infant seat to 30&#34), head wings easily adjust up and down and make napping in the car oh so comfy for our son.  His head never droops forward!- We love the easy clean fabric!!!What we DON'T LIKE:- This seat is HEAVY (24lbs)!!!!!  It DOES fold for travel and IS airline certified, but we would be hard pressed to bring this seat along!- It was a bit tricky to get it installed correctly (i.e. without a wobble - see my Diono Radian Review for tips) and takes a bit of time to install even now that we have a system.  You would not move it from car to car easily.- This is a con and a pro.  This seat is very tall.  It will fit our child well when they are older, but for RF, it is waaay more height than we need right now.(3) Clek FOONFWhat we LIKED:- This is a super SOLID seat!  Well built.- You can just wipe this fabric clean and it is water repellent!!!- We love the RIGID latch, just click it in and go, no straps to tighten.- It is very cool that you can change the angle of recline in FF mode WHILE the seat is installed, so if your child falls asleep you can recline it somewhat.- Another seat with very high limits RF (25-43&#34, 14-50lbs) and FF (30-49&#34, 20-65lbs).- Has a crumple zone built in.- Has actual tested side impact safety (most seats brag this but it is not tested).What we DIDN'T LIKE:- This seat is HEAVY (32lbs).  The heaviest one we looked at!  Even though it is SUPER QUICK AND EASY to install, you would be hard pressed to move this from car to car or take it for airline travel . . . though Clek does sell a duffle for it.- This seat is also very tall and we found it challenging to get our son in and out of it when it was installed next to a window in our sedan.- It is also the most expensive seat we looked at at $400!- The clincher for us to NOT buy this seat, however, was that the crotch strap that you clip the shoulder straps into is very, very short and we felt that it would not fit our son appropriately after the first two years (i.e. it would be way down between his thighs in an uncomfortable way).(4) Recaro ProRideWhat we liked:- This seat is cool.  It is designed by a company that makes race car restraints!- This seat was the most affordable of the four that we looked at.- Yet another seat with high RF (50&#34 or 40lbs), and FF (70lbs).- This seat is light (20lbs).What we didn't like:- This seat is HUGE!!!  By far the biggest of the four.  You would not be able to fit another seat directly next to this one as it is 19&#34 wide (the Radian and the Foonf are both 17&#34).- We could not find a position to install this seat in any of our cars that worked (too big to go behind the driver or passenger seats, too tall to go in the center and blocked the rear view mirror).- When we looked at this seat in person it just looked cheap.  The fabric felt cheap, it felt loosely attached to the frame, the padding all felt thin.- This IS a nice seat and a lot of people really like it, but we felt that it didn't stack up in comparison to the three above seats.  It IS nicer than most seats you'll find at the big box stores.NOTE: You may wonder why Britax, such a notable name is missing from our list.  We did not even consider that Brand an option because the baby expert we were working with alerted us to the toxic chemicals used in the dyes for the red and black Britax seats.  We did not want a tan seat, so that eliminated this Brand as an option for us.  We felt that our kiddo would be spending too much time in a car seat to be breathing toxic fumes!!The bottom line: The best seat is the one that fits in YOUR car and that YOU can install and restrain your child in correctly every time.  Try these for yourself!\",\n",

       " ('I own the 800ft range version of this, which I am sure has little to no differences besides a slight increase in range. The base station unit is very small, very easy to place, very easy to setup and use in general, and has excellent audio pickup. My unit even has an amber colored LED based nightlight on top that you can switch on or off by a push. Nice!The receiver unit somehow manages to impress me even more than the base. It\\'s TINY, it runs on batteries or included AC adapter, has 5 LEDs to indicate intercepted audio level, and the speaker level and clarity does quite nicely. Also, it has a belt clip that comes off very easily if you don\\'t want to use it.The system has four 900mhz channels to choose from. I\\'ve only had this thing less than a day, so I can\\'t yet verify the claims of distance nor can I attest to longevity of the units.Two downsides I\\'d like to comment on, before I digress into what can be done to these devices to make them BETTER.First, the base is corded... Meaning the adapter is hardwired to the unit. I don\\'t like that, because I like to take my electronics to whole new levels for one, and for two, if the adapter dies... you don\\'t just replace it... you find one that matches the voltage requirements and then you have to do some cutting and twisting of wire at the very least. That didn\\'t impress me at all, but then after what I did to my base unit, it\\'s a non issue anyway.The second thing I don\\'t really like is the receiver using AAA batteries. For one, AAA cells don\\'t have NEARLY the lifespan of AA cells, and for two, I wish it used AA\\'s because that\\'s what almost all my stuff uses. I picked things to be this way on purpose - I like universiality. -) It wouldn\\'t have been a tough thing for them to build it to use AA\\'s, it would have had a much longer runtime, and it wouldn\\'t have that badly increased the size of the already absolutely tiny receiver.Now on to the fun stuff. I got this thing not to monitor children, for I have none, and not for chickens, for I have none of those either. I got this to MODIFY, whee hee! And for those of you who are interested, let me say this thing is EASILY modified. It took me less than two hours to open up the base, desolder the hardwired power adapter, and install an LM317 based 6.5 volt regulator circuit with a very common 5.5mm DC power jack. The whole operation went buttery smoothly, I must say, and now my base unit will accept anything from 5 - 15 volts with NO problems other thar than a little warmth and probably a little higher current drain. I now have a base unit that will run on any of the hordes of easily and cheaply available DC adapters (think thrift store or yard sale) and in point of fact runs brilliantly on a car cigarette lighter adapter and is running GREAT out on my porch at this very moment on a small four cell AA pack. CORDLESS, baby! I can now plant my base unit anywhere, even leave it outside on a regular basis with a little weatherproofing say from a plastic ziplock baggie or such as that. God do I wish I\\'d had one of these when I lived in the country in the hills of Tennessee... I could have used this to listen to the local wildlife from the comfort of the indoors whenever I liked. Anyways... distance testing comes tomorrow, I\\'ll be running it on a stronger 6 cell pack for full range and distance testing it thoroughly.Just in case some of you think this is a crazy useless idea... consider the applications:Fully cordless operation on batteries, perfect for power outages or monitoring areas with no AC receptacles.Easy replacement with any common center positive DC adapter with the proper polarity, plug type, and voltage range.MUCH greater spread of potential uses, including easy monitoring of areas outside the home like porches, garages, barns, sheds, wildlife of the two or four legged variety... the list goes on and on. I plan to modify another and keep one for whatever use comes along, and the other will likely be placed permanently in my car to monitor it against breakin or vandalism when I am home and not watching it (who has the time to waste on watching their car, even in a rough neigborhood?). The second I hear any suspicious noises over the receiver, I can go to my window to see what\\'s up. Paranoid? Not at all... last spring I discovered that my car was being used as a worktable by some people that were moving out and didn\\'t care what they did around here anymore.One could even use a pair of these as a type of intercom between two areas, exploiting the four channels to create a full duplex audio link. The more I think it over, the more ideas I get. :-)Anyway... bottom line is these are GREAT little room monitors, and have great potential with a little hacking. Very affordable, very easy to use, and great features, and so far great reception. They have my vote.UPDATE:It\\'s now been 11 days since I bought this thing and modified it, and now I know a LOT more about them, and have more deeply modified both the base and receiver.1) The receiver unit has inside it a tiny potentiometer for squelch adjustment. I found that my receiver was prone to cutting off when there was still plenty of signal to be had, IE, I could get more range. SO, I set my squelch adjustment to completely OFF. No more annoying \"BEEEP BEEEP\" even when signal is GONE, and if you\\'re willing to put up with a bit of static, you can get a LOT more distance.2) I increased the transmit power by adding a very simple PN5179 transistor RF amplifier between the antenna output and the antenna itself. I have probably gained about .1 - .25 watt, enough to be quite noticeable, and harmonic output is still very low. Bear in mind this no doubt violates FCC regs, so do this at your own risk or not at all.3) I did fairly extensive distance testing both before the power increase and after, and have found this unit to perform quite impressively especially in open air conditions. During my field tests BEFORE the power boost, I placed the transmitter on the passenger seat of my car and went walking with an AOR8200 MKII scanner, and found excellent reception in excess of 200 feet (that\\'s through car sheet steel, mind you), and after the power modification I found excellent reception as far away as 300 - 400 feet with the exact same environment and positioning of car and transmitter. If I am indeed to expect 800ft of distance from the stock transmitter, which I believe, then this modification should be getting me as much as 1600ft in the open air. I have not tested this, but I have reason to believe it is true.4) I have since tested the base unit on various power sources, from a four pack of AA NiMH cells to an 8 pack of AA NiMH cells, as well as 12VDC from AC adapters and my car cigarette lighter socket, and have found only the four-AA pack to be wanting, as it only provides 5VDC or just over, and the base now uses 6.5VDC. Temperature inside the case seems to be more than reasonably low, and current drain appears to be less than 50mA no matter how I power it.5) Before the squelch adjustment, I had sporadic losses of signal and difficulty at times in reaquiring signal once lost. After the squelch mod, needless to say, it never cuts out and I have had NO problems of any kind with either the base or the receiver.6) Inside the base unit is a tiny potentiometer that adjusts the microphone level. I was surprised to find that it was set near middle and had MUCH more available gain if I so chose to set it that way. It\\'s my feeling that the stock setting is already a little hot, so I didn\\'t increase it but a hair to make it more suitable to use for detection of subtle noises, for security type situations and the like. In a very noisy environment, I believe this pot could be set much lower for much better clarity in the received audio, although I have not yet tested this theory.Have fun! :-)NR',\n",
